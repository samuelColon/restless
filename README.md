  Restless a 2D java game (Still in the works), where you (the player) aide Aiden in search for the book of black earth; which contains a spell that can revert the untimely demise of his best friend. Grace.
In the process Aiden accidentally causes the world to slowly self implode.
You must fight angels and demons alike to reach the one place where all this can stop.

In a nutshell I wanted to create a game with Asteroids like controls; from a third person view, and dungeon crawler gameplay. 
For simplicity this version of the game is going to have a birds eye view. Really crappy graphics, but will still have that dungeon crawler feel.

This is something that I am creating for fun, to test my abilities and learn along the way.
If 
  you would like to contribute all help is welcome.

   you would like to try out the alpha. Click the eyeball and check back in a month or two.
